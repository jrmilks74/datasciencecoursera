This repository is a submission by James R. Milks to the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains the following main files:
***
* run_analysis.R containing instructions on downloading and cleaning the data following the requirements of the course project
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
***

* FinishedData.txt containing the final product of the analysis
***

* Code Book.rmd listing the R data frames created by run_analysis.R, including variables, size, and other information on the analysis


Along with those three files, I also uploaded the raw data needed to reproduce the analysis in the test and train folders, features.txt, activity_labels.txt, and features_labels.txt files
